## Software Assurance Methodoloties

### Socratic Methodology
The way it works is that the one with the opposing viewpoint is questioned on their rationale for their position, often with a negative form of their question itself (“Questioning the Questioner”).
If someone was to challenge the need for encryption as a disclosure protection mechanism and asks you, “Why is it that I must ensure that data is protected against disclosure threats?”. Instead of giving him answer, question him in return “Why is it that you must NOT ensure that data is protected against disclosure threats?”.

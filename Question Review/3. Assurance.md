## Software Assurance Methodoloties

### Socratic Methodology
The way it works is that the one with the opposing viewpoint is questioned on their rationale for their position, often with a negative form of their question itself (“Questioning the Questioner”).
If someone was to challenge the need for encryption as a disclosure protection mechanism and asks you, “Why is it that I must ensure that data is protected against disclosure threats?”. Instead of giving him answer, question him in return “Why is it that you must NOT ensure that data is protected against disclosure threats?”.

### Six Sigma (6 σ)
Six Sigma is a business management strategy for quality it can be closely related to security because it is used for process improvement by measuring if a product (software) or service is near perfect in quality by eliminating defects.

The key sub-methodologies by which Six Sigma quality can be achieved:
- **DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control)**:  
  For incremental improvement of existing processes.
- **DMADV (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design and Verify):**  
  To develop new processes for Six Sigma products and services.

### Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
CMMI level can be used to rate the maturity of the software development processes of an organization.

### Verification and Validation (V&V)
- Verification evaluates the software to determine whether the product (of a given development phase) performs as required and expected to.
- Validation is the process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.

V&V is a required step in the software acceptance process, irrespective of whether the software is built in-house or procured (acquired).

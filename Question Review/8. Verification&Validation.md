### Verification and Validation (V&V)
- Verification evaluates the software to determine whether the product (of a given development phase) performs as required and expected to.
- Validation is the process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.

V&V is a required step in the software acceptance process, irrespective of whether the software is built in-house or procured (acquired).

V&V is divided into two main activities 
- Review 
- Testing

Notes:
- The request for Common Criteria evaluation assurance levels (EAL) must be in place when procuring software and the EAL claimed by the vendor must be verified.
- Some software may be required to comply with FIPS, PCI-DSS or Common Criteria, those requirements must be verified.

Different kind of tests performed as part of V&V:
- Error detection tests
- Acceptance tests 
	- Regression test: Ensures backward compatibility
	- Simulation test: Checks configuration mismatches and data discrepancy issues
- Independent (Third Party) tests

### Certification and Accreditation (C&A)
How does a government agency validate if a federal information system is compliant, and how does the agency maintain compliance throughout the life cycle of the system? The National Institute of Standards and Technology has developed a four-phase C&A process used by the federal government to certify compliance with mandated federal controls.

-   Initiation and Planning
-   Certiﬁcation
-   Accreditation
-   Continuous Monitoring

<br>

- **Initiation and Planning**: In this phase, the information system owner and the designated Information System Security Ofﬁcer (ISSO1 will formally initiate the C&A process by acknowledging that a C&A is required, establishing a C&A team, developing a project plan with milestones, determining a formal security classiﬁcation for the system and deciding what resources are required to perform a C&A process. In most cases, for commercially-hosted federal systems, the system owner will outsource the C&A process to the systems integrator or Managed Service Provider (MSP1. This is important because the C&A process is a large undertaking and requires substantial resources, including experienced and knowledgeable InfoSec and compliance professionals to complete the C&A package properly.
- 


**Certification** is the technical verification of the software (assess the suitability of software to operate in a computing environment).  
**Accreditation** is management’s formal acceptance of the system after an understanding of the risks associated with it to the computing environment.

### Verification and Validation (V&V)
- Verification evaluates the software to determine whether the product (of a given development phase) performs as required and expected to.
- Validation is the process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.

V&V is a required step in the software acceptance process, irrespective of whether the software is built in-house or procured (acquired).

V&V is divided into two main activities 
- Review 
- Testing

Notes:
- The request for Common Criteria evaluation assurance levels (EAL) must be in place when procuring software and the EAL claimed by the vendor must be verified.
- Some software may be required to comply with FIPS, PCI-DSS or Common Criteria, those requirements must be verified.

Different kind of tests performed as part of V&V:
- Error detection tests
- Acceptance tests
- Independent (Third Party) tests

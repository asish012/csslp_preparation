### Different kinds of risks
- **Residual risk**:  
  (residual risk) = (inherent risk) x (control risk)  
  Residual risk is the risk that remains after the implementation of mitigating security controls.
- **Inherent risk**:  
  Risks before considering controls. Risks that are inherent in the nature of the business and economy.
- **Control risk**:
  The likelihood of a vulnerability wont be caught even if all possible safety measures (controls) would be applied.
- **Detection risk**:  
  Detection risks are the risks that an auditor will not be able to find during audit.  
  Detection risk includes two types of risks. Sampling risk, Non-sampling risk.
  + Sampling risk: When an auditor falsely accepts or erroneously rejects an audit sample.
  + Non-sampling risk: When an auditor fails to detect a condition because of non applying the appropriate procedure or using procedures inconsistent with the audit objectives (detection faults).
- **Secondary risk**:  
  The secondary risk is an outcome of dealing with the original risk.

*Higher inherent risk doesn't mean that there will be vulnerabilities. Because there might be controls in place already against them.*

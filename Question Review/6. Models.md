### Bella-LaPadula (BLP) Confidentiality Model
Deals only with the confidentiality of classified material. It does not address integrity or availability.

It defines the notion of a secure state, i.e., access (read only, write only or read and write) to information, which is permitted based on rules and the classification of the information itself.

- Simple Security property: **No Read Up** (if you have 'read' capability,)
- Star (*) Security property: **No Write Down** (if you have 'write' capability)
- Strong Star Security property: if you have both ‘read’ and ‘write’ capabilities, you can read and write data only at your level of secrecy

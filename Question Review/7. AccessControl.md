## Access Control
- **Discretionary access control (DAC)** is defined as “a means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong”.  
In DAC a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission on to any other subject.  
- **Non-Discretionary Access Control (NDAC)**: The system enforcing the security policies.
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: Access to objects is restricted to subjects based on the sensitivity of the information contained in the objects. The sensitivity is represented by a label. Only subjects that have the appropriate privilege and formal authorization are granted access to the objects.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access that is granted to subjects is based on roles. The resource is not directly mapped to the individual but only to the role.

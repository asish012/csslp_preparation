### Key concepts:
-   Know the difference between certification and accreditation (C&A) and understand how V&V can be used for C&A.
- Impact of the software to the existing system/process.

### Guidelines for Software Acceptance

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- Functionality
- Performance
- Quality
- Safety
- Privacy and Security

**SD3**  
Defense in Depth implies Security in Design, Default, and Deployment.

**EULA** End User Licensing Agreements
**DMCA** Digital Millennium Copyright Act

**Acceptance**: The final checkpoint to discover missed and unforeseen security vulnerabilities and to validate the presence of security controls.

### Software Acceptance Considerations
**What needs to considered when building software in-house**:

**Completion Criteria**  
- Generate the requirements traceability matrix (RTM) that includes security requirements besides functional requirements. (deliverable: **RTM**)
- Generate the threat model. (deliverable: **Threat Model**)
- Review and sign-off on the security architecture. (deliverable: **Security architecture design**)
- Review of code for security vulnerabilities. (deliverable: **Code review report**)
- Completion of security testing after application testing. (deliverable: **Security test report**)
- Completion of documentation before the deployment. (deliverable: **Documentation**)
